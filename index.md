I’m a software developer from Czech Republic living in Dresden, Germany.

I like designing and implementing software for end customers. I’m passionate about building architectures, finding proper abstractions for given problems and keeping things clean and consistent.

My focus lies in development for Apple platforms (in particular macOS and iOS) and the web. Swift is my programming language of choice.

Feel free to contact me anytime!
