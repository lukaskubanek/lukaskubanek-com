Hi there, my name is Lukáš. I’m a software developer from the Czech Republic living in Berlin, Germany.

I’m passionate about building software architectures, finding proper abstractions for given domains and keeping things clean and consistent.

My focus lies in development for Apple platforms (in particular Mac and iOS) and the web. Swift is my programming language of choice - not only because of its extensive role in the Apple development ecosystem but also because of its expressive and safe nature.

Currently, I’m working on a diagramming application together with [Sherpa.Dresden](https://sherpa-dresden.de). More details about this project will be revealed soon.

Besides technology, I'm interested in personal development and minimalism. I also like [hiking](https://www.komoot.com/user/30529433549) and playing volleyball and badminton.

Feel free to get in touch with me.
