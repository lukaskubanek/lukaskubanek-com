Hi there, my name is Lukáš. I’m a software developer from the Czech Republic living in Berlin, Germany.

When developing software, I’m passionate about building architectures, finding proper abstractions for given domains, and keeping things clean and consistent. My focus lies in development for Apple platforms (in particular Mac and iOS). Swift is my programming language of choice.

As a visual kind of person, I draw many diagrams, especially when designing software architectures. For some time I was looking for a suitable digital tool for drawing structured diagrams in a simple way and haven’t found one. This is why I decided to build [Diagrams](https://diagrams.app), an easy-to-use diagram editor for the Mac. Currently, this is my primary project I’m working on together with [Sherpa.Dresden](https://sherpa-dresden.de).

Besides technology and building things, I’m interested in personal development and minimalism. I also do some sports like [hiking](https://www.komoot.com/user/30529433549), volleyball, and badminton.

Feel free to get in touch!
