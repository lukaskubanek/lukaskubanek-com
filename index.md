Hi there, my name is Lukáš. I’m a software developer from Czech Republic living in Dresden, Germany.

I’m passionate about building software architectures, finding proper abstractions for given domains and keeping things clean and consistent.

My focus lies in development for Apple platforms (in particular Mac and iOS) and the web. Swift is my programming language of choice - not only because of its extensive role in the Apple development ecosystem but also because of its expressive and safe nature.

Currently I’m working on a diagramming application together with [Sherpa.Dresden](https://sherpa-dresden.de) and [Honza Martinek](https://jan-martinek.com). More details about this project will be revealed soon.

Besides technology I’m interested in personal development and minimalism. Furthermore I’m a member of the Impact Hub community in Dresden.

Feel free to get in touch with me.
